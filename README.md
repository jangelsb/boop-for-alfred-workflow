# Boop for Alfred

Based off of the widely popular https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop

Quickly run string functions using the text on your clipboard. The output is then copied to your clipboard and pasted back into the editor.

This runs locally in Alfred, using all the same scripts from Boop. It even reads and parses the metadata in each script to allow sorting by the title and tags of a script.

This is as if Boop was made for Alfred.
